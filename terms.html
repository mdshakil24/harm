                        <p>You are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you post to the Services,
                            and for any consequences thereof. The Content you submit, post, or display may be able to be
                            viewed by other users of the Services or members of the public, as well as through
                            third-party services, both online (such as via streaming, download and other digital
                            delivery services) and offline (such as via traditional television distributors).</p>


                        <p>You may use the Services only if you are 18 years of age, you can form a binding contract
                            with HARM and are not a person barred from receiving or using Services under the laws of the
                            United States or other applicable jurisdiction. If you are accepting these Terms and using
                            the Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you
                            represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so. You may use the Services only in
                            compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international
                            laws, rules and regulations.</p>


                        <p>The Services that HARM provides are always evolving, and the form and nature of the Services
                            may change from time to time without prior notice to you. In addition, HARM may stop
                            (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to
                            you or to users generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice. You may need
                            to update third-party software from time to time in order to use the Service. HARM also
                            retains the right to create limits on use at HARM’s sole discretion at any time without
                            prior notice to you.</p>


                        <p>In order to use the Service in any manner, you must enable your mobile device as follows:to
                            receive push notifications from the App; to permit the App to access both the camera and
                            microphone for your device (at your election); and to permit the App to access your location
                            (even in the background, i.e., when the App is not open on your device). (For example, the
                            Service is designed to deliver push notifications to users within a certain radius of a
                            reported incident.) If you do not enable your mobile device accordingly (including enabling
                            any additional features or functions that HARM elects to make mandatory for use of the App),
                            the App will not function on your device.</p>

                        <p>The Services may include advertisements, which may be targeted to the Content, your location,
                            your use of the Services, information regarding the Services, queries made through the
                            Services, or other information. The types and extent of advertising by HARM on the Services
                            are subject to change. In consideration for HARM granting you access to and use of the
                            Services, you agree that HARM and its affiliates, third-party providers and partners may
                            place such advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of Content or
                            information from the Services, whether submitted by you or others.</p>

                        <p>The Services may include links to fundraising initiatives established by third party
                            individuals or fundraising sites (“Fundraisers”). HARM does not endorse particular
                            Fundraisers and does not independently verify that Fundraisers are legitimate or that
                            contributions to a Fundraiser will be used for their stated purpose. You should not rely on
                            HARM to determine whether any Fundraiser information may be inaccurate. Since Fundraisers
                            are created, hosted and operated by third parties, not by HARM, please do your diligence and
                            use your judgment. All donations to a Fundraiser are made at your own risk and HARM bears no
                            liability in this regard.</p>

                        <p>You must provide all equipment and software necessary to connect to the Service, including
                            but not limited to, a mobile device that is suitable to connect with and use the App. You
                            are solely responsible for any fees, including internet connection or mobile fees, that you
                            incur when accessing the Service. </p>

                        <p>Please read this section carefully since it limits the liability of HARM and its parents,
                            subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents,
                            representatives, partners, and licensors (collectively, the “HARM Entities”). Each of the
                            subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some
                            jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of
                            liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to you.
                            Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be
                            lawfully limited.</p>

                        <p>These Terms and the relationship between you and HARM will be governed by the laws of the
                            State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of laws principles that would require
                            the application of the laws of a different country or state. Except for a claim by HARM of
                            infringement or misappropriation of HARM’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret,
                            any and all disputes between you and HARM arising under or related in any way to these Terms
                            must be resolved through binding arbitration as described in this section. This agreement to
                            arbitrate is intended to be interpreted broadly. It includes, but is not limited to, all
                            claims and disputes relating to your use of the Services.</p>

                        <p>YOU AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND HARM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL
                            BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. YOU AND HARM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS
                            AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
                            MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. ANY ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE
                            ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.</p>

                        <p>(a) Any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action
                            (including the interpretation and scope of this clause, and the arbitrability of the
                            controversy, dispute, demand, count, claim, or cause of action) between you and us and our
                            employees, agents, successors, or assigns, regarding or relating to the Services or these
                            Terms shall exclusively be settled through binding and confidential arbitration.</p>
                        <p>(b) Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration
                            law. The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial
                            experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration
                            Association (“AAA”). As modified by these Terms, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the
                            parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s rules for commercial
                            arbitration and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the procedures for
                            consumer-related disputes.</p>

                        <p>(c) You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT
                            for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a
                            NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the
                            arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT.
                            Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED
                            REVIEW BY A COURT.</p>
                        <p>(d) You and we must abide by the following rules: (1) any claims brought by you or us must be
                            brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any
                            purported class or representative proceeding; (2) the arbitrator may not consolidate more
                            than one person’s claims; may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or
                            class proceeding, and may not award class-wide relief, (3) in the event that you are able to
                            demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of
                            litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the
                            arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being
                            cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (4) we also reserve the right in our
                            sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the
                            arbitration; (5) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at
                            law; (6) the arbitrator’s award shall be final and may be enforced in any court of competent
                            jurisdiction; (7) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that
                            are permitted by applicable law; and (8) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses
                            unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its
                            fees’ and litigation expenses, and then in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall
                            be determined by the applicable law.</p>

                        <p>(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or we may bring an individual action in small
                            claims court. Further, claims of infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s
                            patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration
                            agreement. Such claims shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located
                            in New York, New York. Additionally, notwithstanding these Terms to arbitrate, either party
                            may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in New York,
                            New York in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to submit
                            to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within New York, New York for
                            such purpose. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to
                            arbitrate.</p>

                        <p>(f) With the exception of subparts (1) and (2) in the paragraph 14(d) above (prohibiting
                            arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is
                            deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Agreement,
                            then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed
                            in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting
                            provision were not contained herein. If, however, either subparts (1) and (2) in such
                            paragraph (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis) is found to be invalid,
                            unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and
                            void, and neither you nor we shall be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason a claim
                            proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in
                            state or federal court in New York, New York.</p>

                        <p>(g) Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, if we seek to terminate the
                            Dispute Resolution section as included in these Terms, any such termination shall not be
                            effective until 30 days after the version of these Terms not containing the agreement to
                            arbitrate is posted to the Services, and shall not be effective as to any claim of which you
                            provided us with written notice prior to the date of termination. For more information on
                            AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at

                        <p>You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the App and the Service is dependent on
                            the third party from whom you received the App license, e.g., the Apple App Store or Google
                            Play (each, an “App Store”). You acknowledge that the Terms are between you and HARM and not
                            with the App Store. HARM, not the App Store, is solely responsible for the Service,
                            including the App, the content thereof, maintenance, support services, and warranty
                            therefor, and addressing any claims relating thereto (e.g., product liability, legal
                            compliance or intellectual property infringement). In order to use the App, you must have
                            access to a wireless network, and you agree to pay all fees associated with such access. You
                            also agree to pay all fees (if any) charged by the App Store in connection with the Service,
                            including the App. You agree to comply with, and your license to use the App is conditioned
                            upon your compliance with all terms of agreement imposed by the applicable App Store when
                            using any Service, including the App. You acknowledge that the App Store (and its
                            subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of the Terms and will have the right to enforce
                            it.</p>

                            from the Apple App Store: </p>

                        <p>(a) You acknowledge and agree that (i) the Terms are concluded between you and HARM only, and
                            not Apple, and (ii) HARM, not Apple, is solely responsible for the App Store Sourced
                            Application and content thereof. Your use of the App Store Sourced Application must comply
                            with the App Store Terms of Service. </p>

                        <p>(b) You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and
                            support services with respect to the App Store Sourced Application. </p>

                        <p>(c) In the event of any failure of the App Store Sourced Application to conform to any
                            applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the
                            App Store Sourced Application to you and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
                            Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App Store
                            Sourced Application. As between HARM and Apple, any other claims, losses, liabilities,

                        <p>(d) You and HARM acknowledge that, as between HARM and Apple, Apple is not responsible for
                            addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the App Store
                            Sourced Application or your possession and use of the App Store Sourced Application,
                            including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App
                            Store Sourced Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory
                            requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.</p>

                        <p>(e) You and HARM acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the App Store
                            Sourced Application or your possession and use of that App Store Sourced Application
                            infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, as between HARM and Apple, HARM,
                            not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and
                            discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by the
                            Terms. </p>

                        <p>(f) You and HARM acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party
                            beneficiaries of the Terms as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application,
                            and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Terms, Apple will have the
                            right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the Terms as related to
                            your license of the App Store Sourced Application against you as a third-party beneficiary
                            thereof. </p>

                        <p>(g) Without limiting any other terms of the Terms, you must comply with all applicable
                            third-party terms of agreement when using the App Store Sourced Application.</p>

                        <p>The failure of HARM to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a
                            waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to
                            be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the
                            minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full
                            force and effect. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party
                            of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies
                            under these Terms or otherwise. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of
                            law or otherwise, without HARM’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or
                            transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. HARM may freely assign or transfer
                            these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure
                            to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>

                        <p>Any notices or other communications provided by HARM under these Terms, including those
                            regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to
                            the Services. For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on
                            which such notice is transmitted.</p>

                        <p>These Terms and our Privacy Policy are the entire and exclusive agreement between HARM and
                            you regarding the Services (excluding any services for which you have a separate agreement
                            with HARM that is explicitly in addition to or in place of these Terms), and these Terms
                            supersede and replace any prior agreements between HARM and you regarding the Services and
                            Content.</p>

                        <p>We may revise these Terms from time to time, the most current version will always be
                            available within the Services. If the revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will
                            notify you via email to the email associated with your account or through the Services. If
                            you do not wish to be bound by any such revisions to the Terms, you must end these Terms
                            with us as set forth in Section 10 above. By continuing to access or use the Services after
                            those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>
