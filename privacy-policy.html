They may also send you messages, send messages to groups to which you belong, or call you. We require each of these users to have lawful rights to collect, use, and share your information before providing any information to us. 
                            You should keep in mind that in general any user can capture screenshots of your chats or messages or make recordings of your calls with them and send them to Harm or anyone else, or post them on another platform.</li>
                            <li><b>User Reports.</b> Just as you can report other users, other users or third parties may also choose to report to us your interactions and your messages with them or others on our Services; for example, to report possible violations of our Terms or policies.

In addition, some businesses might be working with third-party service providers to help manage their communications with their customers. For example, a business may give such third-party service provider access to its communications to send, store, read, manage, or otherwise process them for the business. To understand how a business processes your information, including how it might share your information with third parties, you should review that business’ privacy policy or contact the business directly.
